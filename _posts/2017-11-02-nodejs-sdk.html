		<h2>How to use</h2>

        <p>IBM Cloud Video provides an example PHP library for some basic API calls. Here you can find what's needed to run the example calls, and download the library.</p>

		<h3>Prerequisites</h3>

		<p>You need PHP, and Composer to install the dependencies. The dependencies are defined in the composer.json file.</p>

		<p>If you have the dependencies installed, you can run the script with the following command: php ustream_api.php</p>

		<p>You need a IBM Cloud Video account with API credentials, and you have to specify:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>your username</li>
			<li>your password</li>
			<li>your client id</li>
			<li>your client secret</li>
			<li>a video id</li>
		</ul>
		<p>at certain points of the script. Look for capitalized texts between angle brackets, like &lt;VIDEO ID&gt;, that's what needs to be changed to actual user info.</p>

		<p>You also need to specify the name of the video file you want to upload. The video has to be in the same folder as the script.</p>

		<h3>Library contents</h3>

		<p>The PHP library contains examples for the following endpoints:</p>

		<ul>
			<li>Authentication</li>
			<li>List channels</li>
			<li>List videos</li>
			<li>Upload a video</li>
			<li>Download a video</li>
			<li>Request a downloadable video</li>
		</ul>
