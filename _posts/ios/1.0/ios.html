                    <h2>Introduction</h2>
                    <p>The Ustream Player SDK lets you play Ustream live and recorded videos in your native applications. Using the native SDK gives you full control over the Player, including a customizable native user interface, callbacks on status changes, and many more. (Note: if you need none of the above, you may use the HTML-based <a href="https://github.com/ustream/embedapi/blob/master/README.md">Player API</a> instead)</p>
                    <p>This document describes the basic steps to make a mobile app using the Player SDK for iOS.</p>

                    <h4>Xcode</h4>
                    <p>The Player SDK requires <strong><a href="https://developer.apple.com/xcode/">Xcode 5</a></strong>, targeting <strong>iOS 7.0 or above</strong>.</p>
                    
                    
                    <h4>Frameworks</h4>
                    <p>The Player SDK requires the <code>MobileCoreServices.framework</code>.</p>
   
                    
                    <h4>Dynamic libraries</h4>

                    <h2>Step 2: Create (or open) your project</h2>
                    <p>Open the project that you would like to integrate the SDK in.</p>
                    <p>In case you wish to use a new project, follow these steps in Xcode:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Choose File > New > New Project.</li>

                    <h2>Step 3: Add the SDK to the project</h2>
     
                    
                    <h4>1. Add the library to your project</h4>
                    <p>The required resources are included in the USPlayer directory in the PlayerSDK package: the static library (libUSPlayerSDK.a), the header files and the resource bundle (USPlayerResources.bundle).</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Unzip the package and copy the USPlayer directory into your project’s source directory.</li>
                        <li>Add the files to your project from XCode.</li>
                        <li>Make sure that <code>libUSPlayerSDK.a</code> is included into <code>Target Settings/Build Phases/Link Binary With Libraries</code>.</li>
                        <li>Add the required frameworks and dynamic libraries to <code>Target Settings/Build Phases/Link Binary With Libraries</code>.</li>
                        <li>Make sure that <code>USPlayerResources.bundle</code> is included into <code>Target Settings/Build Phases/Copy Bundle Resources</code>.</li>
                    </ol>
        
                    
                    <h4>2. Set up linker options</h4>
                    <p>Since <code>libUSPlayerSDK.a</code> contains some category implementations, you need to set the flag "-ObjC" in your project’s <code>Build Settings/Other Linker Flags</code>.</p>
                </section>
                
                
                
                
                <section>
                    <h2>Step 4: Register your app at Ustream</h2>
                    <p>The SDK requires the use of a <em>Ustream API key</em>, which is validated whenever the SDK communicates with Ustream streaming servers. The sample application contains a sample API key which you can use for testing. The sample API key can only be used to play content on the test channel(s) also used in the sample app.</p>
                    <p>Before you can start using the Player SDK for playing content from your own channel(s), you will need to:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>get a valid <strong>Ustream API key</strong> owned by the Ustream user that owns the content you would like to play</li>
                        <li>register the <strong>application identifier(s)</strong> - of every app in which you will integrate the Player SDK in - at Ustream</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p class="note">The application identifier is typically structured as <code>com.your_company.your_project</code>.</p>

                    <p>Before you can create and use an instance of the player you have to configure the lib with your <strong>Ustream API key</strong>:</p>
                    <pre><code class="objectivec">[USUstreamPlayer configureWithApiKey:<strong>place your API key here</strong>];</code></pre>
                </section>
                
                
                
                
                
                <section>
                    <h2>Step 5: Create a Player</h2>
                    <p><code>USUstreamPlayer</code> can be instantiated in the usual way using <em>alloc+init</em> or <em>new</em>. The created player object is a subclass of the <code>USUstreamPlayer</code> optimized for the targeted device (iPhone or iPad).</p>
                    
                    <p>For example:</p>
                    <pre><code class="objectivec">self.ustreamPlayer = [[USUstreamPlayer alloc] init];
self.ustreamPlayer.delegate = self;
self.ustreamPlayer.view.frame = self.view.bounds;
self.ustreamPlayer.view.autoresizingMask = UIViewAutoresizingFlexibleWidth | UIViewAutoresizingFlexibleHeight;
[self.view addSubview:self.ustreamPlayer.view];</code></pre>
                </section>
                
                
                
                
                <section>
                    <h2>Step 6: Play live or recorded content</h2>
                    <p>By now you have configured your player and it is ready to play live and recorded video content via Ustream.</p>
                    <p><code>USUstreamPlayer</code> can play different kinds of media:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Live streams using the <code>-[USUstreamPlayer playChannel:]</code> API call.</li>
                        <li>Recorded videos using the <code>-[USUstreamPlayer playRecorded:]</code> API call.</li>
                        <li>Highlights using the <code>-[USUstreamPlayer playHighlight:]</code> API call.</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <p>For example you can play the live video streamed right now on your channel:</p>
                    <pre><code class="objectivec">[self.ustreamPlayer playChannel:<strong>place your channel id here</strong>];</code></pre>
                </section>
                
                
                
                
                <section>
                    <h2>Step 7: Handle Player callbacks</h2>
                    <p>Ustream content owners can protect their content using various "locks" that implement password protection, age restriction and other limitations. Streaming servers reject clients connecting for playback if lock conditions are not met. The SDK calls the appropriate callback function to indicate this to the application.</p>
 
                    
                    
                    <h3>Generic callbacks</h3>
                    <p><code>USUstreamPlayer</code> reports its state changes using the <code>USPlayerDelegate</code> protocol. It may also require user interaction in case the servers indicate the Player about content restrictions (so-called "locks") set up by the Ustream user. In order to catch these callbacks you have to set a handler conforming to protocol <code>USPlayerDelegate</code> as a delegate of your player instance.</p>
   
                    <p>For example:</p>
                    <pre><code class="objectivec">self.ustreamPlayer.delegate = self;</code></pre>
  
                    
                    <h4>Player state is changed</h4>
                    <p>The player instance reports its state changes so that application states can be updated accordingly. For example your app can change the layout of the player screen depending on whether playback is in progress.</p>
                    <p>When the Player sends the callback:
                    <pre>(void)playerStateDidChange:(USUstreamPlayer *)player</pre>
                    <p>it indicates that the state of the Player has changed so that you may choose to act on it. The states are listed in the <code>USPlayerState</code> enum.</p>

                    
                    
                    <h3>Interactive callbacks</h3>
                    <p>Callbacks caught can be "interactive": they can be used to reconnect for playback using some kind of user input.</p>
                    
                    
                    <h4>Password lock</h4>
                    <p>When the Player sends the callback:</p>
                    <pre>(void)playerRequiresPassword:(USUstreamPlayer *)player</pre>
                    <p>it waits for a password belonging to the locked content. You can provide the password using</p>
                    <pre>continueWithPassword:(NSString *)password</pre>
                    <p>If you provide the password, the player validates it and starts playing the content if the password is valid. Otherwise it calls back again with <code>playerRequiresPassword</code>.</p>
  
                    
                    <h4>Age lock</h4>
                    <p>When the Player sends the callback</p>
                    <pre>(void)playerRequiresAgeConfirmation:(USUstreamPlayer *)player ageRequired:(NSUInteger)age</pre>
                    <p>or the callaback:</p>
                    <pre>(void)playerRequiresBirthdate:(USUstreamPlayer *)player</pre>
                    <p>you need to ask the user's birth date without hints to the required age. If the user-specified age is not less than the required age, you can continue the playback with <code>continueWithAgeConfirmed</code>.</p>
                </section>

                
                
                
                
                <section>
                    <h2>Step 8: Refine the Player UI</h2>
    
                    
                    
                    <h3>Appearance</h3>
                    <p><code>USUstreamPlayer</code> includes a full-featured user interface by default, including a control bar, loading and error views. You can change this behavior by setting the <code>playerControlStyle</code> property of the player. By setting it to <code>USPlayerControlStyleNone</code> you can instruct the player to display media only, without any decoration views.</p>
                    <p>In case you don’t want to handle all the player states and error cases manually, you can also reconfigure the control bars by setting their content using the <code>USUstreamPlayer (USToolbar)</code> category.</p>
                    <p>You can set any of the player toolbar’s contents using the <code>-[USToolbar setToolbarItems:animated:]</code> API. The standard toolbar items are accessible in the <code>USUstreamPlayer (USToolbar)</code> category, and you can create your own items as well by subclassing <code>USToolbarItem</code>.</p>
                    
                    
                    
                    <h3>Localization</h3>
                    <p>Ustream provides localizations for all strings used in the Player SDK in the following languages:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>English</li>
                        <li>Spanish</li>
                        <li>Japanese</li>
                        <li>Korean</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>If you want to provide more languages and/or redefine texts, include the keys listed below into the localization files of your application. If you don’t redefine these keys, then the SDK will fall back to the localizations included in the resource bundle of the SDK.</p>
